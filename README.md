Link State Routing (LSR) Simulator

This is a Python/Java-based Link State Routing (LSR) simulator, which simulates the process of routing updates in a network using the link-state algorithm. The program allows users to input the network topology, including the connected routers and their link costs, and calculates the shortest path using algorithms like Dijkstra's.

Features

Simulates a Link State Routing protocol in a network with multiple routers.

Allows the user to input the network topology and link costs.

Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path from one router to another.

Displays the routing table for each router in the network.
Usage

1. Input the network topology, specifying the routers and the link costs between them.


2. The program will run the Link State Routing algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm) and compute the shortest path from the source router to all other routers.


3. The routing table will be displayed for each router, showing the next hop and the cost to reach each destination.
